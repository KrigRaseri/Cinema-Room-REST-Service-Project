# Cinema REST Controller Project
Hyperskill project to create a REST controller for a cinema ticket booking system.

and respond with JSON objects.

## Project Progress
- **Stage 1/4:** Project started. Created initial commits and project structure. Created a simple end point to return a all
available seats in the cinema. This part was pretty easy, but took longer because I spent a good amount of time 
binging on Spring tutorials.


- **Stage 2/4:** Created an end point to purchase a ticket, and also implement exception handling for bad requests. I spent
way too long going back and forth on how to organize my layers, and naming conventions. Then I ended up getting stuck
on how to make a post request with a seat object body. Turns out I understood it, the problem was I did not format the
generated request right and therefore was not getting a correct response. Then I had some trouble with the global and
custom exceptions but finally got it. Ended up having a big gap in progress due to moving and other life events.
